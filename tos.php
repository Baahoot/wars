 PsychoWars.net TERMS OF SERVICE  Last updated February 1, 2015 IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS DETAILED IN THE “DISPUTES” SECTION.  Welcome to the Psychowars, Game Service, PsychoWars.net Desktop, PsychoWars.netnet, PsychoWars.net Customer Service (“PsychoWars.net CS”), and the other PsychoWars.net-owned websites, software and apps that link to these Terms of Service (collectively referred to in these Terms of Service as the “Services”). The Services are owned and operated by BaaHoot, Inc. (“PsychoWars.net” or “PsychoWars.net” or "we" or "us"). The PsychoWars.net Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern our relationship with anyone who accesses the Services by any method or means, including but not limited to accessing the Services through any version of an PsychoWars.net controller (“Controller”) or the MicroConsole TV adapter, or a Mac™, PC, iPad™ or other tablet, or a mobile device such as a smartphone, or any other connected device.   These Terms of Service constitute an update to both the prior Terms of Service and the last version of our Terms of Use, which have been merged into these Terms of Service.  Please read the Terms, the PsychoWars.net Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) and the PsychoWars.net Acceptable Use Guidelines (“Guidelines”) carefully. Your use of the Services constitutes your agreement to the Terms, the Privacy Policy, and the Guidelines. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.  Your use of the Services is only for purposes that are permitted by these Terms. Any use or access of the Services by any means other than those authorized by these Terms is prohibited unless specifically agreed to in writing with PsychoWars.net.   On an ongoing basis, PsychoWars.net makes changes and additions to the Services including but not limited to: new games, features, and functionality. We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally. Your continued use of the Services after these new changes and additions are made will indicate your acceptance of any such changes and additions and your continued acceptance of the Terms, the Privacy Policy, and the Guidelines.  You may not use the Services if you do not agree to be, or are unable to be, bound by the Terms, the Privacy Policy, and the Guidelines. 
 1. Privacy  The Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference, tells you about the way we handle and protect your personal information (as referenced in the Privacy Policy) when you use the Services.   
 2. Acceptable Use Guidelines  In order to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all of our users, we have established certain ground rules regarding your behavior on the PsychoWars.netnet Game Service that are specified in the Guidelines, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Guidelines apply to your use of the PsychoWars.net Game Service and to any and all Game Service User Generated Content and Your Desktop Content (as defined in Section 9 below) that you contribute to the Services. PsychoWars.net reserves the right to close or suspend your PsychoWars.net Services Account (“Account”) if you breach the Guidelines.  
 3. Eligibility  By registering for or maintaining an Account on the Services, you must: 
 (a) be at least 18 years of age or instead have reached the age of majority in your province, territory or state of residence if that age is greater than 18, and 
 (b) be a current resident of the United States or Canada (“Account Holder”). As an Account Holder, you represent and warrant to PsychoWars.net that you meet the eligibility criteria in the preceding sentence. If you are an Account Holder and a parent or guardian of a minor aged 13 or older (“Minor”), you may allow the Minor to access the Services using your Account under your supervision, but by doing so you acknowledge and agree to the following: * You grant the Minor full authority to bind you to contracts within or using the Service, such as by accepting updates to our Terms of Service, by accepting agreements imposed by Third Party Services, or by making purchases through the Services. * We may treat all activity associated with the Account as having been performed by and approved by you, and you expressly ratify all such activity and are fully responsible for it.  * The Service will provide access to games and other content that is rated mature or that you or others may otherwise consider objectionable or inappropriate for persons under age 18. * The Service will allow one-to-one or group communication, including written and verbal discussion (such as through voice chat and text), between the Minor and other users, including those who may not be Minors. * The Services facilitate the collection and sharing of information, as discussed in the Privacy Policy, and it may appear to recipients of the shared information that you are the originator of the shared information that actually relates to or originates from the Minor.  * The Services facilitate interaction with Third Party Services, some of which may prohibit users in certain age brackets (e.g., under 18) or prohibit the sharing of Accounts. It is entirely your responsibility to ensure that your decision to share your Account does not lead to a violation of your agreement with the Third Party Services.  
 4. Accepting and Changing the Terms  You will be deemed to have accepted the Terms by 
 (a) downloading to a desktop, laptop, iPad or other tablet, mobile device, or obtaining through any other means on any other device or medium, the PsychoWars.net Application Software; 
 (b) installing the PsychoWars.net Application Software; 
 (c) clicking to agree to the Terms; or 
 (d) accessing the Services. If you do not accept the Terms prior to accessing the Services, you will be deemed to have accepted the Terms upon any access of the Services.  We may change the Terms at any time in our sole discretion. The effective date of the Terms of Service will be calculated as follows:  * For the effective date of future updates to the Terms of Service: All changes to the Terms will come into effect 10 days after the posting of such changes unless we choose to secure your immediate acceptance of revised Terms via a click-through confirmation or acceptance button. We will notify you of any material changes to the Terms by presenting the new Terms when you start the Services, or we may choose to inform users of changes via email. Continued use of the Services after the 10-day notice period or after you have clicked to agree to new Terms, regardless of whether we have contacted you regarding such changes and regardless of whether you have read the changes we have made available to you, will constitute acceptance of the Terms.  * For the effective date of this version of the Terms of Service: The same procedure will apply, except that the 10-day period mentioned above will instead be 15 days.   
 5. Third Party Terms and Services  A. In General. Our Services offer connectivity with a growing number of services provided by third parties, such as social networks, content providers, platforms, communications tools, plugins and widgets of many varieties (collectively, “Third Party Services”). The providers of Third Party Services may have their own disclosures, policies, and agreements including but not limited to third party end user license agreements, privacy policies, and terms of service (“Third Party Terms”).

PsychoWars.net Desktop  While accessing or using PsychoWars.net Desktop, you may create or download information, such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images that you place on PsychoWars.net Desktop (“Your Desktop Content”). Your Desktop Content remains your content. We also do not control, verify, or endorse the content that you and others make available on PsychoWars.net Desktop.   You control who may access Your Desktop Content. If you share Your Desktop Content in public areas of the Services or in shared areas available to others, then you agree that anyone you have shared Your Desktop Content with may use that content. When you give others access to Your Desktop Content on the Services, you grant them free, nonexclusive permission to use, reproduce, distribute, display, transmit, and communicate to the public the content solely in connection with the Services and other products and services made available by PsychoWars.net.

You understand that we collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with PsychoWars.net Desktop. If you add a file to Your Desktop Content that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your Account rather than storing a duplicate.

We will not pay you for Your Desktop Content. We may refuse to publish Your Desktop Content for any or no reason. We may remove Your Desktop Content from the Services at any time if you are in violation of the Terms or if we cancel or suspend PsychoWars.net Desktop.  We are not responsible for deletion or overwriting of Your Desktop Content or other data or files, or accidental loss of Your Desktop Content or other data or files, or actions of any application that may be operating on PsychoWars.net Desktop. We strongly advise users to back up Your Desktop Content to other locations. As set forth in Section 13 below, if your Account is closed, we may permanently delete Your Desktop Content from our servers. In addition, we have no obligation to return Your Desktop Content to you if your Account is closed as set forth in Section 13 below, or if PsychoWars.net discontinues PsychoWars.net Desktop.  PsychoWars.net Desktop provides cloud-accelerated web browsing with up to gigabit Ethernet speed connections to the Internet for extremely fast, but brief, data transfers. These connections are shared with other PsychoWars.net users. Sustained high-speed data transfers that excessively impact these shared connections are not permitted. Please be reasonable. Your Internet usage may be limited by PsychoWars.net in its sole discretion. PsychoWars.net will limit PC applications that may be added. Malware or other applications that may compromise security or reliability are not permitted. PsychoWars.net may, at its sole discretion, limit Internet usage, limit PsychoWars.net Desktop usage, and limit the applications that can be used with PsychoWars.net Desktop. Subject to the terms of Section 13 below (“Account Closure”), you can access Your Desktop Content through the free PsychoWars.net service; however, such, access depends upon availability of shared connections. Users with paid subscriptions will have priority access ahead of users utilizing the free service.  C. Other Content  The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. PsychoWars.net does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, the related content, products, or services. You are solely responsible for your use of any such websites or resources.   10. Communications  Communications within the Services (including oral and written communications) should not be considered private. For example, Voice Chat communications and written messages may be heard and observed by others as part of gameplay or during Spectating. PsychoWars.net is under no obligation to monitor user communications but reserves the right to act on reports of misconduct or abuse of such privileges at PsychoWars.net’s sole discretion. Because Voice Chat and other communications may be widely viewed and/or heard, PsychoWars.net cautions users to avoid revealing any personally identifiable information through such communications.  11. PsychoWars.net Purchases and Billing  ALL SALES ARE FINAL. ALL FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE, TRANSFERABLE, OR REDEEMABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART. NO RETROACTIVE DISCOUNTS. Offers are only valid within the United States and Canada. Offers cannot be combined unless expressly stated. Some game purchases may not be available for all platforms and different prices may be charged for different platforms (e.g., PC, Mac, iPad and other tablets, and the MicroConsole TV adapter). Promotion codes and coupons have no cash value.  Subject to any PsychoWars.net promotional offers you may accept, PsychoWars.net may require payment of fees for certain aspects of the Services, third party content, any additional items and services that may be available through the Services, and any applicable taxes. You must register for an Account to access various features of the Services and to pay for any third party content. Some features of the Services may require that you have subscribed to, purchased or otherwise acquired certain content or features within the Services or within a Third Party Service. All purchases are charged in U.S. dollars.  
 A. Free Accounts PsychoWars.net allows you to store up to 2 GB of Your Desktop Content free of charge. PsychoWars.net reserves the right to terminate free Accounts at any time, with or without notice. Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, if a free Account is inactive for ninety (90) days, then PsychoWars.net may delete any or all of Your Desktop Content without providing additional notice as provided in Section 13 below.  
 B. Paid Features A payment card may be required to sign up for certain Services or a given service offering (“Paid Features”). If you do not have a valid payment card on file, PsychoWars.net may suspend your access to your Account or some or all Paid Features until you provide updated, valid payment card information. Please be advised that if you seek to use a payment card for payments related to the Services, you represent that you are authorized to use that payment card. You must also be authorized to use any subsequent payment card in the event you change or update the payment card you used to register. By providing a payment card to PsychoWars.net whether or not immediately prior to a specific purchase, you expressly authorize PsychoWars.net to charge you for services and products you subsequently purchase under your Account including but not limited to required or optional fees associated with maintaining a subscription in good standing (the “Subscription Fees”), third party content, any additional items and services that may be available through the Services, and any applicable taxes. PsychoWars.net will bill you in accordance with the terms of your subscription. Purchases are subject to any additional terms provided at the time of purchase.  Prices for any third party content are subject to change at any time without notice. PsychoWars.net reserves the right to change the pricing, billing and subscription fee plans for the Services at any time. In the event PsychoWars.net makes any such changes to the Services, we will provide you with at least thirty (30) calendar days’ notice via the email address you have provided in your Account. If you do not consent to these changes, you must stop using the relevant Services or you may close your Account. In the event your Account is closed for any reason, PsychoWars.net reserves the right to charge you for any costs, surcharges, or debts still pending on your Account. You may not register for a new Account until all costs, surcharges, and debts are settled for any prior PsychoWars.net Account that you have used, or have been used with the same payment card or email address.  If PsychoWars.net offers a Service feature (such as a subscription) that provides remote access to games that you have downloaded, PsychoWars.net may discontinue that feature for any games at any time.  
 C. Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this Section 11, if PsychoWars.net discontinues a Service (such as SL Go) before you have used all of the minutes you have purchased for that particular Service, then after discontinuation PsychoWars.net will either (i) if permitted by law, allow you to request that the prorated value of the minutes be applied to the your general PsychoWars.net account (in which case the remaining value will be calculated based on the actual purchase price of each minute, and an account that has held minutes purchased at different per-minute prices will be deemed to have been used on a first-purchased, first-spent basis), or (ii) handle the minutes balance as otherwise required by law.  
 12. MicroConsole and Controller  The Terms also apply to use of the MicroConsole and Controller and from time to time other hardware that may be provided with them such as a wireless adapter. Use of the MicroConsole or Controller or other such ancillary hardware provided confirms your agreement to:   * Accept the Terms, any Third Party Terms and any subsequent changes.  * Accept any software updates and upgrades sent to the MicroConsole and/or Controller. * Accept any different or additional terms applicable to the third party components included with the MicroConsole and/or Controller. * Not tamper with in any manner, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise modify the MicroConsole and/or Controller. * Save as permitted by law, not derive (or attempt to derive), modify, decompile, or remove any software code from the MicroConsole and/or Controller. * Not remove any proprietary notices or labels from the MicroConsole and/or Controller. * Use any software in the MicroConsole or Controller only in executable form and solely in conjunction with the MicroConsole or Controller.  Basic information relating to setup, installation and support is shipped with the MicroConsole and Controller, and further details are found in the Support section of the PsychoWars.net website.  
 13. Account Closure  CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT WILL RESULT IN PERMANENT LOSS OF ACCESS, CONTENT, SERVICES AND VALUE ON THE PsychoWars.net SERVICES. PLEASE READ THIS “ACCOUNT CLOSURE” SECTION CAREFULLY BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH CLOSURE.  You may close your Account at any time. If you decide to close your Account, please contact PsychoWars.net CS from the Support section of the PsychoWars.net website. Voluntary Account closure may immediately and permanently terminate your access to the Services using the closed Account; immediately and permanently terminate your access to all content, messages, services on the Services that the closed Account would otherwise have access to or could derive value from; and result in your immediate and permanent forfeiture of any coupons, access passes, credits, Game Service , Your Desktop Content, or anything that may be of value directly or indirectly associated with the Account, if any, whether purchased or not. However, PsychoWars.net may restore an Account that was voluntarily closed, where such restoration is requested within 14 days and PsychoWars.net is not exercising its right under this Section to close such Account.  PsychoWars.net may close an Account if it determines in its sole discretion that you have violated these Terms of Service or the PsychoWars.net Acceptable Use Guidelines or under certain other conditions specified in the Terms. In such cases, Account closure by PsychoWars.net will not immediately and permanently terminate your Account until at least 14 days after closing. We may keep your Account data for longer periods to protect PsychoWars.net’s or others’ rights and property, to prevent fraud, or where we in good faith believe such longer retention is required by law or legal process we may have received. For all closed Accounts, we reserve the right to retain information as necessary or appropriate for lawful business purposes, to prevent fraud, to protect PsychoWars.net’s rights and property, or as required by law (e.g., we may keep financial and transactional records that are required for accounting, revenue-reporting and tax-reporting purposes).  Any remaining payments due on the Account will remain due and collectible after the Account is closed until they are paid.

This shall, in no way, affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions in the Terms.   
 23. Miscellaneous  You and PsychoWars.net are independent parties, and nothing in the Terms constitutes a partnership or joint venture between you and PsychoWars.net or makes either party the agent of the other. Unless otherwise specified herein, the Terms, the PsychoWars.net Privacy Policy, and the Guidelines constitute the entire agreement between you and PsychoWars.net with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, negotiations and proposals with respect to such subject matter. You may not assign or transfer the Terms or any of your rights or obligations under the Terms (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of PsychoWars.net. These Terms shall be binding on you, your assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and estate. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may be assigned by us without restriction.  Pursuant to the Communications Decency Act, we notify you that commercially available parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors outside the Services. Information identifying current third-party providers of such protections is available by searching for “parental control software” on Google.net or Yahoo.net. Please note that the PsychoWars.net itself does not provide these parental control tools, has not tested or evaluated them and does not endorse them. Any use of such tools is at your sole risk, and their effectiveness may decrease over time. You should not assume that any third-party parental control software works well or at all in connection with the Services. Please see Section 3 for important restrictions on the use of our Services by minors.  
 24. Beta Program  PsychoWars.net may from time-to-time establish a Beta program (“Beta”) to give certain users an opportunity to test and experience additional new features of the Services, pay for and use third party content, and gather feedback on the new features and content on the Services. Any and all information made available to you by virtue of your participation in a Beta, whether furnished to you directly by PsychoWars.net or learned by you through your access to a Beta, is confidential to PsychoWars.net. For example, you may not do any Tweets, Facebook posts, or other online posting of details, and you may not post or otherwise communicate screenshots, or videos, or any other content whatsoever about your participation in a Beta. You may disclose that you are a participant in a Beta, but you may not discuss with or disclose to any third party any information you learn through a Beta including your opinions regarding a Beta. If you are chosen to participate in a Beta, you will:  * Carry out the testing in connection with a Beta personally. You will not display or provide access to the Services to any other person.  * Use your best efforts to secure your system and the Beta against unauthorized access or disclosure. * Never disclose any information about a Beta, including, without limitation, any information about the Services provided or made available by PsychoWars.net or any hardware, software, screenshots, video, or other code or scripts to any third party.  * Never discuss gameplay, quality of service, or bugs encountered while using a Beta anywhere outside of PsychoWars.net’s provided in-site forums and customer support. * Delete and destroy all information related to a Beta in your possession or control immediately upon the request of PsychoWars.net, and confirm deletion and destruction of such information if requested to do so by PsychoWars.net.  You agree that any breach by you of this confidentiality provision will cause irreparable harm to PsychoWars.net, and PsychoWars.net is entitled to seek ex parte injunctive relief to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your obligations.  As a Beta user, you agree to:   * Test and evaluate a Beta and/or devices to be used with the Beta, including, but not limited to, audiovisual content, features, functionality, capabilities, operation, Service performance and device performance.  * Inform PsychoWars.net of any bugs or other defects you encounter in connection with the Services. * Receive all software updates and upgrades, if any that PsychoWars.net sends to the MicroConsole, to your computer, or to any hardware or software associated or used in connection with the Services, including the Controller. * Comply with reasonable requests and instructions from PsychoWars.net in connection with Beta, which may be provided from time to time during a Beta, including, but not limited to, requests and instructions to test or evaluate specific aspects of the Services.  * Provide PsychoWars.net with your comments, feedback, evaluations, analyses, suggestions and recommendations regarding a Beta (“Feedback”), all as voluntarily provided by you or as may otherwise be requested by PsychoWars.net.  Your participation in a Beta is strictly voluntary and for your enjoyment. While your participation in a Beta is helpful, you understand that it is not a vital part of the development of the Services so as to give you any right to compensation. Participation in one phase of a Beta does not entitle you to participation in any other phase of a Beta, if any, or to any compensation with respect to the Services. You acknowledge and agree that your participation in a Beta (or any phase of a Beta) does not give you any claim of ownership to any part of the Services. All Feedback that you provide or make available to PsychoWars.net during a Beta, however communicated by you and whether at PsychoWars.net’s request or not, shall be the sole and exclusive property of PsychoWars.net, and you hereby irrevocably assign to PsychoWars.net all of your right, title and interest in and to such Feedback, including, without limitation, any and all intellectual property rights in or to any such Feedback. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, you agree that PsychoWars.net and its successors, assigns and licensees shall have the perpetual and irrevocable right to reproduce, modify and otherwise use and exploit all of the Feedback (and any and all portions and derivatives thereof) in any manner now known or hereafter devised for any purposes, including, but not limited to, in connection with the development and exploitation of the Services or any other product or service, without any compensation or the provision of any credit to you. You hereby waive all “moral rights” with respect to all Feedback and all copyrights therein to the extent such moral rights can be waived under the existing law of any jurisdiction, and all uses thereof, and consent to any action of PsychoWars.net that would violate such moral rights in the absence of such waiver or consent.  All other terms in the Terms continue to apply to your participation in a Beta.
